I tried to run the given scripts, but every time a lot of errors appear. I think, it is because of the arm architecture of my macbook.\
I tried to launch several virtual machines, but it gave no profit, because the disk image for the vm should use the arm architecture too.\
Now I am trying to create a correct Dockerfile with the given BlockReward projects to build docker image and be able to launch it inside the container.
